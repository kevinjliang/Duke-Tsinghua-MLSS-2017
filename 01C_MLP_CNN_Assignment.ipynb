For more difficult optimization spaces (such as the ones deep networks pose), we might want to use more sophisticated algorithms. Prof David Carlson has a lecture on this later.\n",

Normally, we validate on the entire validation set, but for the sake of time we'll just stick to 10 validation minibatches (500 images) for this homework assignment."
