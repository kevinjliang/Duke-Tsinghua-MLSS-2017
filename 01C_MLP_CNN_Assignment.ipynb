    "CNN is more accurate than MLP, but it cost much more time than MLP does. However we should notice that CNN cost a lot of time to train, but once the model is trained well, it does not cost much time to do the classification tasks. So if we have enough time to train, CNN should be preferred. As far as I know, MLPs are not applied to other image datasets."
