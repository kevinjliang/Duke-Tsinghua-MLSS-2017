# Duke-Tsinghua Machine Learning Summer School (MLSS) 2017

Welcome to the [Duke-Tsinghua Machine Learning Summer School 2017](https://dukekunshan.edu.cn/en/events/machine-learning-2017)! This repository contains the lecture materials for the TensorFlow Workshops, as well as the homework assignment for the Introduction to Multilayer Perceptrons and Convolutional Neural Networks lectures.

## Before you arrive
Most of the content for this workshop is organized into Jupyter IPython notebooks. Please go through the notebooks labeled 00[ABC] **before** you come to the Duke-Kunshan campus. These notebooks will walk you through the steps of installing Python and TensorFlow, as well as give a condensed tutorial on Python coding environments and Git. Some basic understanding of coding in Python is assumed, so if you're new or a little rusty, brushing up before the class is recommended.

By the end of the 3 pre-requisite notebooks, you should have a local copy of your fork of this repository on the laptop you intend to bring to the MLSS, know how to open a notebook in Jupyter, and while you don't need to go through the material itself, be able to run all cells ("Cell > Run all") within [01A_TensorFlow_Basics.ipynb](https://github.com/kevinjliang/Duke-Tsinghua-MLSS-2017/blob/master/01A_TensorFlow_Basics.ipynb) without errors. If you have any difficulties with these steps, there will be office hours at the start of the MLSS to help sort out any difficulties.
